# Celestial Mechanics

This repository contains a notebook with calculations about celestial mechanics. It is useful to predict the positions of the the planets in the solar system based in a date.

It calculates orbital parameters of the planets in the solar system given the time in days from ```01/01/2000```, calculates the eccentric anomaly, true anomaly, the heliocentric distance of the planets and etc.

## Dependencies:

**Python** is needed to run the notebook. *Check [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if python is not already installed.*

<pre>
Python dependencies:
  
jupyter matplotlib numpy pandas
</pre>

## Installation:

Inside a python virtual environment, follow the instructions below:

1. **Installing dependencies:**
   
  ```bash
  pip install jupyter matplotlib numpy pandas
  ```

2. **Clone this repository:**
   
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sunbaee/CelestialMechanics.git
  ```

3. **Entering jupyter:**
   
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```

Then, in jupyter notebook, you can access the ```CelestialMechanics``` folder and use the notebook as pleased.
